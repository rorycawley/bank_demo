The reason for having a different interface for queries (`ICartQueryService`) versus commands (`ICartRepository`) relates to applying the principles of **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** and maintaining **clear separation of concerns** in your architecture.

Here’s exactly why this distinction is made:

---

## ✅ **1. Commands vs. Queries (CQRS):**

**CQRS** explicitly separates the responsibilities of:

- **Commands** (Write operations that change system state, e.g., `AddToCart`)
- **Queries** (Read operations that retrieve data without modifying state, e.g., `GetCart`)

### **Commands (e.g., `AddToCart`):**
- Typically operate on **Aggregates**.
- Involve domain logic and business rules validation.
- Persist state changes through repositories.
- Need to maintain consistency, transaction boundaries, and business invariants.

Therefore, they directly interact with **repositories**, which abstract persistence details.

```csharp
ICartRepository
├─ LoadCartAsync
└─ SaveCartAsync
```

---

### **Queries (e.g., `GetCart`):**
- Typically optimized for **fast reads**.
- Often return **read-specific data** (`ReadModels`) that are projections optimized for client needs.
- Shouldn't involve complex domain logic or affect domain state.
- Can be optimized separately, even using a different database or read-model storage.

Therefore, queries use a dedicated **query service** rather than the repository directly:

```csharp
ICartQueryService
└─ GetCartAsync
```

This allows the flexibility to:

- Use optimized read queries or projections (e.g., SQL Views, NoSQL stores, caching layers).
- Independently scale and tune read vs. write concerns.

---

## ✅ **2. Why Not Just Use Repositories for Both?**

You **can**, but it becomes problematic because:

- Repositories expose domain-focused persistence methods (`Save`, `Load`) and often return full aggregates, which can be inefficient for simple reads.
- Queries frequently require different, optimized representations (`ReadModels`) rather than complete domain entities (aggregates).

Having separate query interfaces (`ICartQueryService`) ensures **optimized and efficient reads** tailored specifically for client needs.

## ✅ **3. Summary of Differences:**

| Aspect                 | **Commands** (`AddToCart`) | **Queries** (`GetCart`)       |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Responsibility         | Write (modify state)       | Read (no state change)        |
| Domain Logic           | Yes                        | No (minimal/none)             |
| Returns                | Domain aggregates/entities | Read-optimized projections    |
| Interface              | Repository                 | Query Service                 |
| Implementation Details | Aggregate persistence      | Optimized queries/projections |

---

## ✅ **Conclusion:**

The difference between your two features (`AddToCart` and `GetCart`) is intentional, directly aligning with **CQRS principles**, clearly separating **read and write concerns**, and allowing independent optimization and scalability of your queries and commands.
