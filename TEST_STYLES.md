Here's a detailed, structured breakdown of **principles**, **tenets**, **patterns**, **practices**, **benefits**, and **outcomes** for each type of test in your architecture:

---

# 🧪 Unit Testing

## ✅ Principles
- **Test behaviour, not implementation**
- **One test per use case scenario**
- **Isolate domain logic from infrastructure**
- **Test the system through its ports (handlers)**

## 📜 Tenets
- Only test what changes under business rules
- Keep tests stable across refactors
- Tests are fast, deterministic, isolated
- Each test validates a **single business rule**

## 🧩 Patterns
- **Command/Query Handler as Port**
- **Fakes and in-memory stubs** for dependencies
- **Domain Event Assertion** pattern
- **Arrange–Act–Assert (AAA)** structure

## 🧰 Practices
- Place tests in the same structure as vertical slices
- Use fakes/stubs for repositories, workflow engines, rules engines
- Test handler classes directly (not adapters or DTOs)
- Use expressive test names: `Should_Emit_X_When_Y`

## 🌟 Benefits
- Fast feedback for developers
- High confidence in core business logic
- Easy to write and understand
- Encourages clean, testable architecture

## 🎯 Outcomes
- Your domain and use cases are **trusted and safe to refactor**
- Tests **document behaviours** in the system
- You gain **developer confidence and velocity**

# 🔌 Integration Testing

## ✅ Principles
- **Test ports + adapters working together**
- **Drive the system through its use case handler**
- **Assert real interaction with infrastructure components**

## 📜 Tenets
- Ensure correct **infrastructure wiring**
- Validate side effects (e.g., persistence, messaging)
- Realistic, not fully end-to-end
- Use actual implementations for output adapters

## 🧩 Patterns
- **Test a vertical slice with real infra**
- Use **in-memory adapters** for event store, messaging, DB
- **Fake output, real ports** pattern
- **Adapter contract verification**

## 🧰 Practices
- Use real implementations of `IRepository`, `IEventStore`, etc.
- Use stub implementations for external systems (e.g., `IWorkflowEngine`)
- Keep test data setup minimal and clear
- Assert on **observable side effects** (e.g., events saved, workflows triggered)

## 🌟 Benefits
- Catch integration issues early
- Provides confidence that components compose correctly
- Doesn’t require full system bootstrapping (faster than system tests)
- Provides deep feedback on vertical slice integrity

## 🎯 Outcomes
- Confirms that the system **persists and reacts correctly**
- Reduces risk of **runtime wiring failures**
- Validates **use case infrastructure** paths

---

# 🌐 System Testing

## ✅ Principles
- **Test the full system from the outside in**
- **Use public interfaces only (Web API, CLI)**
- **Assert both result and observable side effects**

## 📜 Tenets
- Treat the system as a **black box**
- Use only public-facing, task-based APIs
- Test **realistic end-to-end use case flows**
- Only assert observable business behaviour

## 🧩 Patterns
- **Task-based API + Workflow Validation**
- **Submit-Then-Check** pattern (e.g., POST then GET)
- Use **WebApplicationFactory** to spin up real FastEndpoints app
- CLI adapter as test driver (alternate adapter pattern)

## 🧰 Practices
- Call the API or CLI as a user would
- Bootstrap the real app with test DI and infra
- Drive multiple related use cases to test flow (e.g., Submit → Status)
- Avoid coupling to internal classes or structure

## 🌟 Benefits
- Confidence that the system behaves as expected in production
- Validates routing, DI, endpoints, use cases, and infra wiring
- Documents real-world usage of the system
- Exposes high-level regressions

## 🎯 Outcomes
- Ensures **feature-level correctness**
- Guarantees the system meets **business expectations**
- Shows real user workflows operate correctly under test

|----------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| ✅ **Purpose**         | Validate behaviour of core logic       | Validate wiring of domain + infrastructure | Validate behaviour of full system     |
| 🎯 **Driven By**       | Handler (port)                         | Handler (port) with real infra            | Public API or CLI                     |

| ⏱ **Speed**           | Very fast                              | Fast-ish (real infra, no UI)              | Slower (full stack)                   |

| 🤝 **Uses Fakes**      | For everything external                | Only for external systems (e.g., BPMN)    | Minimal, full stack used              |
| 🧰 **Example Tooling** | xUnit + fakes                          | xUnit + in-memory infra                   | xUnit + WebApplicationFactory + Http  |
